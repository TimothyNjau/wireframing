# Wireframing
This refers to creating a visual guide that acts as a representation of a skeletal framework for a website or digital product. It's a blueprint for the final design.
This process is important in the design process for the following reasons:  
- It facilitates communication among team members, clients, and stakeholders.
- Helps to identify any potential usability issues early on, for example, navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Aids in clarifying ideas and concepts by visualizing the layout and structure.
- Allows for easy modifications, as it's simpler and less costly to alter wireframes than a developed product.
- Acts as a guide for subsequent design and development phases.
- Allows the designers to focus on functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure:  define the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
