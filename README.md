# Wireframing
This refers to creating a visual guide which acts as representation of a skeletal framework for a webite or digital product. Its a lueprint for the final design.
This process is important in the design process, for the following reasons:  
- It facilitates communication among team members, clinets and stakeholders.
- Helps to identify any potential usability issues early on, for example, navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Aids in clarifying ideas and concepts by visualizing the layout and structure.
- Allows for easy modifications, as its simpler and less costly to alter wireframes than a developed product.
- Acts as a guide for subsequent design and development phases.
- Allows the designers to focus on functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.
