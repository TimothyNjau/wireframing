# Wireframing
This refers to creating a visual guide that acts as a representation of a skeletal framework for a website or digital product. It's a blueprint for the final design.
This process is important in the design process for the following reasons:  
- It facilitates communication among team members, clients, and stakeholders.
- Helps to identify any potential usability issues early on, for example, navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Aids in clarifying ideas and concepts by visualizing the layout and structure.
- Allows for easy modifications, as it's simpler and less costly to alter wireframes than a developed product.
- Acts as a guide for subsequent design and development phases.
- Allows the designers to focus on functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure:  define the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.

## Types of Wireframes
There are two types of wireframes: low-fidelity and high-fidelity
  * Low Fidelity wireframing
   This is the most basic type of wireframing. It focuses on the overall structure and functionality without detailed designs. It can even be achieved using a pen and paper, by drawing simple sketches. In Figma, it's achieved by drawing basic digital layouts  in grayscale. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines.
  * High Fidelity wireframing
    This is a more detailed and refined version, which is closer to the final design. It can also include more specific layout and design elements like colors, graphics, and font styles. The UI elements look realistic and might even include textures and shadows.

## Wireframing Tools - Figma
Figma is a cloud-based design tool widely used for UI/UX design, prototyping, and collaboration. It allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to work together in real-time within a shared workspace—no software installation needed. Given that it is browser-based, sharing wireframes is as easy as sharing a link. Teams can also leave comments within the file.  
**Key Features for Wireframing**
- Has an intuitive interface: drag-and-drop components, layout grids, vector tools
- Makes use of reusable components, which allow for consistency across wireframes.
- Multiple users can view or edit a file simultaneously, with comments and version control.
- Given that it's a web-based tool, it can be operated from any platform, thus making it cross-platform.
- Easily link frames together to create interactive wireframe flows.

Figma streamlines the process of turning ideas into visual structures. It’s ideal for brainstorming layouts, creating low-fidelity wireframes, and quickly iterating based on feedback—all within one tool. Its collaboration features make it especially valuable for teams working remotely or cross-functionally.  
Whether you're a beginner sketching your first app or a seasoned designer mapping out user journeys, Figma makes wireframing faster, more visual, and more collaborative.
