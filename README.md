# Wireframing
This refers to creating a visual guide that acts as a representation of a skeletal framework for a website or digital product. It's a blueprint for the final design.
This process is important in the design process for the following reasons:  
- It facilitates communication among team members, clients, and stakeholders.
- Helps to identify any potential usability issues early on, for example, navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Aids in clarifying ideas and concepts by visualizing the layout and structure.
- Allows for easy modifications, as it's simpler and less costly to alter wireframes than a developed product.
- Acts as a guide for subsequent design and development phases.
- Allows the designers to focus on functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure:  define the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.

## Types of Wireframes
There are two types of wireframes: low-fidelity and high-fidelity
  * Low Fidelity wireframing
   This is the most basic type of wireframing. It focuses on the overall structure and functionality without detailed designs. It can even be achieved using a pen and paper, by drawing simple sketches. In Figma, it's achieved by drawing basic digital layouts  in grayscale. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines.
  * High Fidelity wireframing
    This is a more detailed and refined version, which is closer to the final design. It can also include more specific layout and design elements like colors, graphics, and font styles. The UI elements look realistic and might even include textures and shadows.
